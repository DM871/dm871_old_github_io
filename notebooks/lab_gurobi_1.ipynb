    "# Solving MILP Problems in Python - Part 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment aims at introducing students to mathematical modeling\n",
    "languages. These languages make it possible to write in an easy and compact way problems in\n",
    "Linear Programming (LP), Integer Programming (IP) and Mixed Integer\n",
    "Linear Programming (MILP) and to instantiate them in MILP\n",
    "solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well known mathematical programming languages are:\n",
    "[AMPL](http://www.ampl.com/), [GAMS](http://www.gams.com/),\n",
    "[ZIMPL](http://zimpl.zib.de/) and [GNU\n",
    "MathProg](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/). The last two are open\n",
    "source.\n",
    "\n",
    "These languages are declarative type of languages, as opposed to\n",
    "procedural type. That is, they can be used to define the problem without saying how it\n",
    "should be solved. Moreover, they allow to separate the model from the\n",
    "data. In fact, that is essentially all what they do, they *instantiate*\n",
    "the model on the given data. The output that is used by the solver can\n",
    "also be used for debugging purposes, that is, to check that the explicit\n",
    "model is as expected. There are two formats in which an instantiated\n",
    "MILP can be exported to a file: `.mps` format, which is an almost\n",
    "universal format among solver systems, but that is not easy to read and\n",
    "`.lp` format, which is more readable (introduced by CPLEX).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of solvers for MILP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Gurobi (Version 9.1.1 and later),\n",

    "-   FICO XPRESS (Version 8 and later),\n",
    "\n",
    "-   IBM CPLEX (version 12.10 and later).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are commericial solvers. Commercial solvers remain maybe 6-7 time\n",
    "faster than the main free/open-source solvers:\n",
