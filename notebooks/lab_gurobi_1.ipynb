    "\n",
    "The assignment aims at introducing the students to mathematical modeling\n",

    "Well known mathematical programming languages are:\n",
    "[AMPL](http://www.ampl.com/), [GAMS](http://www.gams.com/),\n",
    "[ZIMPL](http://zimpl.zib.de/) and [GNU\n",
    "MathProg](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/). The last two are open\n",
    "source.\n",
    "\n",
    "These languages are declarative type of languages, as opposed to\n",
    "procedural type. That is, we define the problem without saying how it\n",
    "should be solved. Moreover, they allow to separate the model from the\n",
    "data. In fact that is essentially all what they do, they *instantiate*\n",
    "the model on the given data. The output that is used by the solver can\n",
    "also be used for debugging purposes, that is, to check that the explicit\n",
    "model is as expected. There are two formats in which an instantiated\n",
    "MILP can be exported to a file: `.mps` format, which is an almost\n",
    "universal format among solver systems, but that is not easy to read and\n",
    "`.lp` format, which is more readable (introduced by CPLEX).\n",

    "\n",
    "-   IBM CPLEX (version 12.10).\n",
